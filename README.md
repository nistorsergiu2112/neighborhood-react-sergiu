# Neighborhood Map Project

This app uses Google Maps API to help the user find coffee shops in Bucharest, Romania. It was developed through the Udacity - Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

I built this with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Google Maps API and create-react-app.

## Project description:
- A single page application featuring a neighborhood map and a listing of coffee shops in Bucharest, Romania.
- The Google Maps API is used to generate the map. The Foursquare API is used to get information to display when a marker is clicked. Information such as photos, address and names are displayed in the InfoBox.
- A filter feature and animations makes it easy to navigate between the Markers.
